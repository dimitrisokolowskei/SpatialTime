# SpatialTime 
Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables single cell resolution gene expression analysis assessment across histology sections while preserving the tissue native morphological configuration. In this context, SpatialTime package empower users to access gene expression, pathways scores and co-expression gene modules by establishing spatially defined reference points and calculating ST spots distances against the arbitrarily defined reference spots using euclidean distances. Thus, a distance gradient can be established allowing the evaluation of gene expression profiling based on proximity of any reference line.     

## Installation
```sh
#(install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dimitrisokolowskei/SpatialTime")
```
